# **Analysis of coffee samples using attenuated total reflectance mid infrared spectroscopy**

## **1. Introduction**

## **2. Materials and Methods**

### **2.1. Coffee samples**

Four coffee samples brewed in the Spring of 2021 were prepared and stored at -4 dC in 4 falkon tubes containing 100 mL of sample each. Each sample contained the following codes refereing to the sample preparation method:

- **Sample 1 (B)** Finer, 7.77% 18:5 - 47 (45-6)
- **Sample 2 (A)** Optimal, 7.2% 18:5 - 47
- **Sample 3 (C)** 15-25
- **Sample 4 (D)** 17.2 1.25 %

### **2.2. ATR-MIR analysis**
An ATR-MIR spectrometer from Perkin Elmer equiped with a ATR cell using a diamond as crystal allowing a single bounce of light at 45 degrees was used to analyse the different coffe samples. A single beam of air in the dark at 22 dC was used as background to analyze the different samples.

Each sample was thawed at room temperature and homogeneized using a vortex. Then, 1 mL of sample was transferred to the ATR cell and covered from light during the analysis. For each sample, five spectra were recorded each of them containing 100 scans. The mean spectrum of each sample was used for further analysis. 

The abosrbance spectrum of each sample was calculated from their transmittance spectrum. Prior to the analysis, each spectrum was ATR corrected. 

In between samlpes, the ATR cell was thoroughly cleaned using ethanol 70% first and rinsing with milliQ water later. A water spectrum was measured in between samples as quality control of the cleaning process.

## **3. Results**
The spectra of the different coffee samples is shown in Figures 1-4.
